1.Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has $x_1=6$ and $x_2=10$?
x1>7.5 => B, x1<7.5 => A; obs. that has x1=6 and x2=10 I would classify as A
2.What size is the margin here?
size of the margin is 2
3. Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
6,7,8,9,10 receive a penalty; observation 8 is the support vector
4. What is the total penalty here?
total penalty is 5.75
5. Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
yes
6. Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
yes the data is separable; support vectors are 8,4, and 9
