1. Both candidates have similar expected productivity - score of 75. The pros of picking candidate A is that they consistently show this high score (low variance) - the productivity will probably not be much less than 75. However, the probability this candidate will have higher score for productivity is low. Candidate B on average earns the score of 75 as well, but his productivity might be significantly higher. The con of hiring B is that the productivity could also be much lower that 75. 
2. Here A consistently gets the productivity score of 60, however, there is little chance he will perform better than candidate B, whose average score is 80. The forecasts are non-overlapping and Candidate B, despite higher variance, is always expected to perform better than A. 
3. This probabilistic forecast seems to be biased as most of the actual responses lie to the right side to the median of the distribution.
